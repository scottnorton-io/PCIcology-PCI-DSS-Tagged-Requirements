| req_id | title |
|--------|-------|
| 6.3.1 | Security vulnerabilities are identified and managed as follows: • New security vulnerabilities are identified using industry-recognized sources for security vulnerability information, including alerts from international and national computer emergency response teams (CERTs). • Vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking based on industry best practices and consideration of potential impact. • Risk rankings identify, at a minimum, all vulnerabilities considered to be a high-risk or critical to the environment. • Vulnerabilities for bespoke and custom, and third-party software (for example operating systems and databases) are covered. |
| 6.4.1 | For public-facing web applications, new threats and vulnerabilities are addressed on an ongoing basis and these applications are protected against known attacks as follows: • Reviewing public-facing web applications via manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods as follows: - At least once every 12 months and after significant changes. - By an entity that specializes in application security. - Including, at a minimum, all common software attacks in Requirement 6.2.4. - All vulnerabilities are ranked in accordance with requirement 6.3.1. - All vulnerabilities are corrected. - The application is re-evaluated after the corrections OR • Installing an automated technical solution(s) that continually detects and prevents web-based attacks as follows: - Installed in front of public-facing web applications to detect and prevent web-based attacks. - Actively running and up to date as applicable. - Generating audit logs. - Configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated. Note: This requirement will be superseded by Requirement 6.4.2 after 31 March 2025 when Requirement 6.4.2 becomes effective. |
| 6.4.2 | For public-facing web applications, an automated technical solution is deployed that continually detects and prevents web-based attacks, with at least the following: • Is installed in front of public-facing web applications and is configured to detect and prevent web-based attacks. • Actively running and up to date as applicable. • Generating audit logs. • Configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. This new requirement will replace Requirement 6.4.1 once its effective date is reached. |
| 10.3.4 | File integrity monitoring or change-detection mechanisms is used on audit logs to ensure that existing log data cannot be changed without generating alerts. |
| 10.7.1 | Additional requirement for service providers only: Failures of critical security control systems are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of the following critical security control systems: • Network security controls. • IDS/IPS. • FIM. • Anti-malware solutions. • Physical access controls. • Logical access controls. • Audit logging mechanisms. • Segmentation controls (if used). Note: This requirement will be superseded by Requirement 10.7.2 as of 31 March 2025. |
| 10.7.2 | Failures of critical security control systems are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of the following critical security control systems: • Network security controls. • IDS/IPS. • Change-detection mechanisms. • Anti-malware solutions. • Physical access controls. • Logical access controls. • Audit logging mechanisms. • Segmentation controls (if used). • Audit log review mechanisms. • Automated security testing tools (if used). Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment and will supersede Requirement 10.7.1. |
| 11.2.1 | Authorized and unauthorized wireless access points are managed as follows: • The presence of wireless (Wi-Fi) access points is tested for, • All authorized and unauthorized wireless access points are detected and identified, • Testing, detection, and identification occurs at least once every three months. • If automated monitoring is used, personnel are notified via generated alerts. |
| 11.5.1 | Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques are used to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network as follows: • All traffic is monitored at the perimeter of the CDE. • All traffic is monitored at critical points in the CDE. • Personnel are alerted to suspected compromises. • All intrusion-detection and prevention engines, baselines, and signatures are kept up to date. |
| 11.5.1.1 | Additional requirement for service providers only: Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques detect, alert on/prevent, and address covert malware communication channels. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 11.5.2 | A change-detection mechanism (for example, file integrity monitoring tools) is deployed as follows: • To alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including changes, additions, and deletions) of critical files. • To perform critical file comparisons at least once weekly. |
| 11.6.1 | A change- and tamper-detection mechanism is deployed as follows: • To alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including indicators of compromise, changes, additions, and deletions) to the security-impacting HTTP headers and the script contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser. • The mechanism is configured to evaluate the received HTTP headers and payment pages. • The mechanism functions are performed as follows: - At least once weekly OR - Periodically (at the frequency defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1). Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 12.4.2 | Additional requirement for service providers only: Reviews are performed at least once every three months to confirm that personnel are performing their tasks in accordance with all security policies and operational procedures. Reviews are performed by personnel other than those responsible for performing the given task and include, but are not limited to, the following tasks: • Daily log reviews. • Configuration reviews for network security controls. • Applying configuration standards to new systems. • Responding to security alerts. • Change-management processes. |
| 12.10.5 | The security incident response plan includes monitoring and responding to alerts from security monitoring systems, including but not limited to: • Intrusion-detection and intrusion-prevention systems. • Network security controls. • Change-detection mechanisms for critical files. • The change-and tamper-detection mechanism for payment pages. This bullet is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 12.10.5 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. • Detection of unauthorized wireless access points. |
