|--------|-------|
| 5.3.2 | The anti-malware solution(s): • Performs periodic scans and active or real-time scans. OR • Performs continuous behavioral analysis of systems or processes. |
| 5.3.2.1 | If periodic malware scans are performed to meet Requirement 5.3.2, the frequency of scans is defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 5.3.3 | For removable electronic media, the anti-malware solution(s): • Performs automatic scans of when the media is inserted, connected, or logically mounted, OR • Performs continuous behavioral analysis of systems or processes when the media is inserted, connected, or logically mounted. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 11.3.1 | Internal vulnerability scans are performed as follows: • At least once every three months. • Vulnerabilities that are either high-risk or critical (according to the entity's vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved. • Rescans are performed that confirm all high-risk and critical vulnerabilities (as noted above) have been resolved. • Scan tool is kept up to date with latest vulnerability information. • Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists. |
| 11.3.1.1 | All other applicable vulnerabilities (those not ranked as high-risk vulnerabilities or critical vulnerabilities according to the entity’s vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are managed as follows: • Addressed based on the risk defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1. • Rescans are conducted as needed. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 11.3.1.2 | Internal vulnerability scans are performed via authenticated scanning as follows: • Systems that are unable to accept credentials for authenticated scanning are documented. • Sufficient privileges are used for those systems that accept credentials for scanning. • If accounts used for authenticated scanning can be used for interactive login, they are managed in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 11.3.1.3 | Internal vulnerability scans are performed after any significant change as follows: • Vulnerabilities that are either high-risk or critical (according to the entity's vulnerability risk rankings defined at Requirement 6.3.1) are resolved. • Rescans are conducted as needed. • Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV). |
| 11.3.2 | External vulnerability scans are performed as follows: • At least once every three months. • By PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV). • Vulnerabilities are resolved and ASV Program Guide requirements for a passing scan are met. • Rescans are performed as needed to confirm that vulnerabilities are resolved per the ASV Program Guide requirements for a passing scan. |
| 11.3.2.1 | External vulnerability scans are performed after any significant change as follows: • Vulnerabilities that are scored 4.0 or higher by the CVSS are resolved. • Rescans are conducted as needed. • Scans are performed by qualified personnel and organizational independence of the tester exists (not required to be a QSA or ASV). |
| 11.2 | Perform internal and external vulnerability scans |
