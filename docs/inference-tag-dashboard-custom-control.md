This includes cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). • Attacks on access control mechanisms, including attempts to bypass or abuse identification, authentication, or authorization mechanisms, or attempts to exploit weaknesses in the implementation of such mechanisms. • Attacks via any "high-risk" vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability identification process, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1. |
| 6.3.1 | Security vulnerabilities are identified and managed as follows: • New security vulnerabilities are identified using industry-recognized sources for security vulnerability information, including alerts from international and national computer emergency response teams (CERTs). • Vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking based on industry best practices and consideration of potential impact. • Risk rankings identify, at a minimum, all vulnerabilities considered to be a high-risk or critical to the environment. • Vulnerabilities for bespoke and custom, and third-party software (for example operating systems and databases) are covered. |
| 6.3.2 | An inventory of bespoke and custom software, and third-party software components incorporated into bespoke and custom software is maintained to facilitate vulnerability and patch management. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 6.5.1 | Changes to all system components in the production environment are made according to established procedures that include: • Reason for, and description of, the change. • Documentation of security impact. • Documented change approval by authorized parties. • Testing to verify that the change does not adversely impact system security. • For bespoke and custom software changes, all updates are tested for compliance with Requirement 6.2.4 before being deployed into production. • Procedures to address failures and return to a secure state. |
| 8.2.3 | Additional requirement for service providers only: Service providers with remote access to customer premises use unique authentication factors for each customer premises. |
| 8.3.10 | Additional requirement for service providers only: If passwords/passphrases are used as the only authentication factor for customer user access to cardholder data (i.e., in any single-factor authentication implementation), then guidance is provided to customer users including: • Guidance for customers to change their user passwords/passphrases periodically. • Guidance as to when, and under what circumstances, passwords/passphrases are to be changed. Note: This requirement for service providers will be superseded by Requirement 8.3.10.1 as of 31 March 2025. |
| 8.3.10.1 | Additional requirement for service providers only: If passwords/passphrases are used as the only authentication factor for customer user access (i.e., in any single-factor authentication implementation) then either: • Passwords/passphrases are changed at least once every 90 days, OR • The security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access to resources is automatically determined accordingly. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. Until this requirement is effective on 31 March 2025, service providers may meet either Requirement 8.3.10 or 8.3.10.1. |
| 8.6.2 | Passwords/passphrases for any application and system accounts that can be used for interactive login are not hard coded in scripts, configuration/property files, or bespoke and custom source code. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 11.4.7 | Additional requirement for multi-tenant service providers only: Multi-tenant service providers support their customers for external penetration testing per Requirement 11.4.3 and 11.4.4. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 12.3.2 | A targeted risk analysis is performed for each PCI DSS requirement that the entity meets with the customized approach, to include: • Documented evidence detailing each element specified in Appendix D: Customized Approach (including, at a minimum, a controls matrix and risk analysis). • Approval of documented evidence by senior management. • Performance of the targeted analysis of risk at least once every 12 months. |
| 12.9.1 | Additional requirement for service providers only: TPSPs provide written agreements to customers that include acknowledgements that TPSPs are responsible for the security of account data the TPSP possesses or otherwise stores, processes, or transmits on behalf of the customer, or to the extent that the TPSP could impact the security of the customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. |
| 12.9.2 | Additional requirement for service providers only: TPSPs support their customers' requests for information to meet Requirements 12.8.4 and 12.8.5 by providing the following upon customer request: • PCI DSS compliance status information (Requirement 12.8.4). • Information about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the TPSP and which are the responsibility of the customer, including any shared responsibilities (Requirement 12.8.5), for any service the TPSP provides that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on behalf of customers or that can impact security of customers’ cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. |
| A1.1.1 | Logical separation is implemented as follows: • The provider cannot access its customers' environments without authorization. • Customers cannot access the provider's environment without authorization.
