## 12.3.1: For each PCI DSS requirement that specifies completion of a targeted risk analysis, the analysis is documented and includes:
- Identification of the assets being protected. 
- Identification of the threat(s) that the requirement is protecting against. 
- Identification of factors that contribute to the likelihood and/or impact of a threat being realized. 
- Resulting analysis that determines, and includes justification for, how the frequency or processes defined by the entity to meet the requirement minimize the likelihood and/or impact of the threat being realized. 
- Review of each targeted risk analysis at least once every 12 months to determine whether the results are still valid or if an updated risk analysis is needed. 
- Performance of updated risk analyses when needed, as determined by the annual review. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

## 3.5.1: PAN is rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored by using any of the following approaches:
- One-way hashes based on strong cryptography of the entire PAN. 
- Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN). - If hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN, or different truncation formats of the same PAN, are present in an environment, additional controls are in place such that the different versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. 
- Index tokens. 
- Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures.

## 6.3.1: Security vulnerabilities are identified and managed as follows:
- New security vulnerabilities are identified using industry-recognized sources for security vulnerability information, including alerts from international and national computer emergency response teams (CERTs). 
- Vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking based on industry best practices and consideration of potential impact. 
- Risk rankings identify, at a minimum, all vulnerabilities considered to be a high-risk or critical to the environment. 
- Vulnerabilities for bespoke and custom, and third-party software (for example operating systems and databases) are covered.
