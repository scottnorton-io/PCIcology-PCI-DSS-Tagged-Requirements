- Updating all data-flow diagrams per Requirement 1.2.4. 
- Identifying all locations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted, including but not limited to:

1) any locations outside of the currently defined CDE, 
2) applications that process CHD, 
3) transmissions between systems and networks, and 
4) file backups. 
- Identifying all system components in the CDE, connected to the CDE, or that could impact security of the CDE. 
- Identifying all segmentation controls in use and the environment(s) from which the CDE is segmented, including justification for environments being out of scope. 
- Identifying all connections from third-party entities with access to the CDE. 
- Confirming that all identified data flows, account data, system components, segmentation controls, and connections from third parties with access to the CDE are included in scope.

- [ ] Confirm control exists and is documented.
- [ ] Validate evidence supports implementation.
