# Checklist for Requirement 12.3.1: For each PCI DSS requirement that specifies completion of a targeted risk analysis, the analysis is documented and includes: • Identification of the assets being protected. • Identification of the threat(s) that the requirement is protecting against. • Identification of factors that contribute to the likelihood and/or impact of a threat being realized. • Resulting analysis that determines, and includes justification for, how the frequency or processes defined by the entity to meet the requirement minimize the likelihood and/or impact of the threat being realized. • Review of each targeted risk analysis at least once every 12 months to determine whether the results are still valid or if an updated risk analysis is needed. • Performance of updated risk analyses when needed, as determined by the annual review. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
