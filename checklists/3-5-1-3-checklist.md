# âœ… Checklist for Requirement 3.5.1.3

**Title:** If disk-level or partition-level encryption is used (rather than file-, column-, or field--level database encryption) to render PAN unreadable, it is managed as follows:
- Logical access is managed separately and independently of native operating system authentication and access control mechanisms. 
- Decryption keys are not associated with user accounts. 
- Authentication factors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographic keys) that allow access to unencrypted data are stored securely.

- [ ] Confirm control exists and is documented.
- [ ] Validate evidence supports implementation.
- [ ] Assign accountable role.
