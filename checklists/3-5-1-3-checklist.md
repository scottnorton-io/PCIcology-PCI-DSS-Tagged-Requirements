# Checklist for Requirement 3.5.1.3: If disk-level or partition-level encryption is used (rather than file-, column-, or field--level database encryption) to render PAN unreadable, it is managed as follows: • Logical access is managed separately and independently of native operating system authentication and access control mechanisms. • Decryption keys are not associated with user accounts. • Authentication factors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographic keys) that allow access to unencrypted data are stored securely.
