# Checklist for Requirement 7.2.5: All application and system accounts and related access privileges are assigned and managed as follows: • Based on the least privileges necessary for the operability of the system or application. • Access is limited to the systems, applications, or processes that specifically require their use. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
