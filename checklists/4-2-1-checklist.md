# Checklist for Requirement 4.2.1: Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented as follows to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks: • Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted. • Certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are confirmed as valid and are not expired or revoked. This bullet is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. • The protocol in use supports only secure versions or configurations and does not support fallback to, or use of insecure versions, algorithms, key sizes, or implementations. • The encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use.

- [ ] Confirm documentation exists
- [ ] Verify implementation
- [ ] Review evidence artifacts
