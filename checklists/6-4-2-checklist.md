# Checklist for Requirement 6.4.2: For public-facing web applications, an automated technical solution is deployed that continually detects and prevents web-based attacks, with at least the following: • Is installed in front of public-facing web applications and is configured to detect and prevent web-based attacks. • Actively running and up to date as applicable. • Generating audit logs. • Configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. This new requirement will replace Requirement 6.4.1 once its effective date is reached.
