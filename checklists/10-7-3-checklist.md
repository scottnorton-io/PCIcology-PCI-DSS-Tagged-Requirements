# Checklist for Requirement 10.7.3: Failures of any critical security control systems are responded to promptly, including but not limited to: • Restoring security functions. • Identifying and documenting the duration (date and time from start to end) of the security failure. • Identifying and documenting the cause(s) of failure and documenting required remediation. • Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure. • Determining whether further actions are required as a result of the security failure. • Implementing controls to prevent the cause of failure from reoccurring. • Resuming monitoring of security controls. Note: This is a current v3.2.1 requirement that applies to service providers only. However, this requirement is a best practice for all other entities until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
