This includes cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). • Attacks on access control mechanisms, including attempts to bypass or abuse identification, authentication, or authorization mechanisms, or attempts to exploit weaknesses in the implementation of such mechanisms. • Attacks via any "high-risk" vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability identification process, as defined in Requirement 6.3.1.
