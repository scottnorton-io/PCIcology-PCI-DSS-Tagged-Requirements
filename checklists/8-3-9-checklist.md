# Checklist for Requirement 8.3.9: If passwords/passphrases are used as the only authentication factor for user access (i.e., in any single-factor authentication implementation) then either: • Passwords/passphrases are changed at least once every 90 days, OR • The security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access to resources is automatically determined accordingly.

- [ ] Confirm documentation exists
- [ ] Verify implementation
- [ ] Review evidence artifacts
- [ ] Assign owner for validation
