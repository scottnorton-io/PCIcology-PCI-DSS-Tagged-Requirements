# Checklist for Requirement 7.2.5.1: All access by application and system accounts and related access privileges are reviewed as follows: • Periodically (at the frequency defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1). • The application/system access remains appropriate for the function being performed. • Any inappropriate access is addressed. • Management acknowledges that access remains appropriate. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
