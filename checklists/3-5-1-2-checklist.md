# Checklist for Requirement 3.5.1.2: If disk-level or partition-level encryption (rather than file-, column-, or field-level database encryption) is used to render PAN unreadable, it is implemented only as follows: • On removable electronic media OR • If used for non-removable electronic media, PAN is also rendered unreadable via another mechanism that meets Requirement 3.5.1. Note: This requirement is considered a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
