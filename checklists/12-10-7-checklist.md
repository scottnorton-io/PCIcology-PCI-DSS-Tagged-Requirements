# âœ… Checklist for Requirement 12.10.7

**Title:** Incident response procedures are in place, to be initiated upon the detection of stored PAN anywhere it is not expected, and include:
- Determining what to do if PAN is discovered outside the CDE, including its retrieval, secure deletion, and/or migration into the currently defined CDE, as applicable. 
- Identifying whether sensitive authentication data is stored with PAN. 
- Determining where the account data came from and how it ended up where it was not expected.
