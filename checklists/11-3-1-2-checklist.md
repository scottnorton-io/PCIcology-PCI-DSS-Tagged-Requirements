# Checklist for Requirement 11.3.1.2: Internal vulnerability scans are performed via authenticated scanning as follows: • Systems that are unable to accept credentials for authenticated scanning are documented. • Sufficient privileges are used for those systems that accept credentials for scanning. • If accounts used for authenticated scanning can be used for interactive login, they are managed in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
