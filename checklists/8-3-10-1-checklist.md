# âœ… Checklist for Requirement 8.3.10.1

**Title:** Additional requirement for service providers only: If passwords/passphrases are used as the only authentication factor for customer user access (i.e., in any single-factor authentication implementation) then either:
- Passwords/passphrases are changed at least once every 90 days, OR 
- The security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access to resources is automatically determined accordingly. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. Until this requirement is effective on 31 March 2025, service providers may meet either Requirement 8.3.10 or 8.3.10.1.

- [ ] Confirm control exists and is documented.
- [ ] Validate evidence supports implementation.
- [ ] Assign accountable role.
