# Checklist for Requirement 3.2.1: Account data storage is kept to a minimum through implementation of data retention and disposal policies, procedures, and processes that include at least the following: • Coverage for all locations of stored account data. • Coverage for any sensitive authentication data (SAD) stored prior to completion of authorization. This bullet is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 3.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. • Limiting data storage amount and retention time to that which is required for legal or regulatory, and/or business requirements. • Specific retention requirements for stored account data that defines length of retention period and includes a documented business justification. • Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention policy. • A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.
