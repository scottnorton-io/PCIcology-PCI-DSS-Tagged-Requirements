# Checklist for Requirement 8.5.1: MFA systems are implemented as follows: • The MFA system is not susceptible to replay attacks. • MFA systems cannot be bypassed by any users, including administrative users unless specifically documented, and authorized by management on an exception basis, for a limited time period. • At least two different types of authentication factors are used. • Success of all authentication factors is required before access is granted. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
