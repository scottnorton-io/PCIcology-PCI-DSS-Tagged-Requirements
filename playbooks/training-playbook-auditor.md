# Training Playbook: `auditor` Role

## 🔍 Overview
This playbook includes all PCI DSS v4.0.1 sub-requirements tagged for the `auditor` role.

## 🧠 Responsibilities

| Sub-Requirement | Title | Other Tags |
|------------------|--------|-------------|
| 5.3.4 | Audit logs for the anti-malware solution(s) are enabled and retained in accordance with Requirement 10.5.1. | artifact, monitoring, report |
| 6.4.1 | For public-facing web applications, new threats and vulnerabilities are addressed on an ongoing basis and these applications are protected against known attacks as follows: • Reviewing public-facing web applications via manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods as follows: - At least once every 12 months and after significant changes. - By an entity that specializes in application security. - Including, at a minimum, all common software attacks in Requirement 6.2.4. - All vulnerabilities are ranked in accordance with requirement 6.3.1. - All vulnerabilities are corrected. - The application is re-evaluated after the corrections OR • Installing an automated technical solution(s) that continually detects and prevents web-based attacks as follows: - Installed in front of public-facing web applications to detect and prevent web-based attacks. - Actively running and up to date as applicable. - Generating audit logs. - Configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated. Note: This requirement will be superseded by Requirement 6.4.2 after 31 March 2025 when Requirement 6.4.2 becomes effective. | artifact, audit, governance, monitoring, realtime, report |
| 6.4.2 | For public-facing web applications, an automated technical solution is deployed that continually detects and prevents web-based attacks, with at least the following: • Is installed in front of public-facing web applications and is configured to detect and prevent web-based attacks. • Actively running and up to date as applicable. • Generating audit logs. • Configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. This new requirement will replace Requirement 6.4.1 once its effective date is reached. | artifact, monitoring, realtime, report |

| 10.2.2 | Audit logs record the following details for each auditable event: • User identification. • Type of event. • Date and time. • Success and failure indication. • Origination of event. • Identity or name of affected data, system component, resource, or service (for example, name and protocol). | artifact, monitoring, report |
| 10.3.1 | Read access to audit logs files is limited to those with a job-related need. | access-control, artifact, identity, monitoring, report |
| 10.3.2 | Audit log files are protected to prevent modifications by individuals. | artifact, monitoring, report |
| 10.3.3 | Audit log files, including those for external-facing technologies, are promptly backed up to a secure, central, internal log server(s) or other media that is difficult to modify. | artifact, monitoring, report |
| 10.3.4 | File integrity monitoring or change-detection mechanisms is used on audit logs to ensure that existing log data cannot be changed without generating alerts. | artifact, monitoring, realtime, report |
| 10.4.1 | The following audit logs are reviewed at least once daily: • All security events. • Logs of all system components that store, process, or transmit CHD and/or SAD. • Logs of all critical system components. • Logs of all servers and system components that perform security functions (for example, network security controls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers). | artifact, audit, governance, monitoring, report |
| 10.4.1.1 | Automated mechanisms are used to perform audit log reviews. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. | artifact, audit, governance, monitoring, report |
| 10.5.1 | Retain audit log history for at least 12 months, with at least the most recent three months immediately available for analysis. | artifact, monitoring, report |
| 10.7.1 | Additional requirement for service providers only: Failures of critical security control systems are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of the following critical security control systems: • Network security controls. • IDS/IPS. • FIM. • Anti-malware solutions. • Physical access controls. • Logical access controls. • Audit logging mechanisms. • Segmentation controls (if used). Note: This requirement will be superseded by Requirement 10.7.2 as of 31 March 2025. | access-control, artifact, identity, monitoring, realtime, report |
| 10.7.2 | Failures of critical security control systems are detected, alerted, and addressed promptly, including but not limited to failure of the following critical security control systems: • Network security controls. • IDS/IPS. • Change-detection mechanisms. • Anti-malware solutions. • Physical access controls. • Logical access controls. • Audit logging mechanisms. • Segmentation controls (if used). • Audit log review mechanisms. • Automated security testing tools (if used). Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment and will supersede Requirement 10.7.1. | access-control, artifact, audit, developer, governance, identity, monitoring, realtime, report |
