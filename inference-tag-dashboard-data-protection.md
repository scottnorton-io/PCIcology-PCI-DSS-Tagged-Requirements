| req_id | title |
|--------|-------|
| 2.2.7 | All non-console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography. |
| 2.3.1 | For wireless environments connected to the CDE or transmitting account data, all wireless vendor defaults are changed at installation or are confirmed to be secure, including but not limited to: • Default wireless encryption keys. • Passwords on wireless access points. • SNMP defaults. • Any other security-related wireless vendor defaults. |
| 2.3.2 | For wireless environments connected to the CDE or transmitting account data, wireless encryption keys are changed as follows: • Whenever personnel with knowledge of the key leave the company or the role for which the knowledge was necessary. • Whenever a key is suspected of or known to be compromised. |
| 3.3.1 | SAD is not stored after authorization, even if encrypted. All sensitive authentication data received is rendered unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process. |
| 3.3.2 | SAD that is stored electronically prior to completion of authorization is encrypted using strong cryptography. Note: This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 3.3.3 | Additional requirement for issuers and companies that support issuing services and store sensitive authentication data: Any storage of sensitive authentication data is: • Limited to that which is needed for a legitimate issuing business need and is secured. • Encrypted using strong cryptography. This bullet is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 3.3.3 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 3.4.1 | PAN is masked when displayed (the BIN and last four digits are the maximum number of digits to be displayed), such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can see more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN. |
| 3.5.1.2 | If disk-level or partition-level encryption (rather than file-, column-, or field-level database encryption) is used to render PAN unreadable, it is implemented only as follows: • On removable electronic media OR • If used for non-removable electronic media, PAN is also rendered unreadable via another mechanism that meets Requirement 3.5.1. Note: This requirement is considered a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. |
| 3.5.1.3 | If disk-level or partition-level encryption is used (rather than file-, column-, or field--level database encryption) to render PAN unreadable, it is managed as follows: • Logical access is managed separately and independently of native operating system authentication and access control mechanisms. • Decryption keys are not associated with user accounts. • Authentication factors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographic keys) that allow access to unencrypted data are stored securely. |
| 3.6.1 | Procedures are defined and implemented to protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse that include: • Access to keys is restricted to the fewest number of custodians necessary. • Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as the data-encrypting keys they protect. • Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from data-encrypting keys. • Keys are stored securely in the fewest possible locations and forms. |
| 3.6.1.2 | Secret and private keys used to protect stored account data are stored in one (or more) of the following forms at all times: • Encrypted with a key-encrypting key that is at least as strong as the data-encrypting key, and that is stored separately from the data-encrypting key. • Within a secure cryptographic device (SCD), such as a hardware security module (HSM) or PTS-approved point-of-interaction device. • As at least two full-length key components or key shares, in accordance with an industry-accepted method. |
| 3.7.5 | Key management policies procedures are implemented to include the retirement, replacement, or destruction of keys used to protect stored account data, as deemed necessary when: • The key has reached the end of its defined cryptoperiod. • The integrity of the key has been weakened, including when personnel with knowledge of a cleartext key component leaves the company, or the role for which the key component was known. • The key is suspected of or known to be compromised. • Retired or replaced keys are not used for encryption operations. |
| 4.2.1 | Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented as follows to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks: • Only trusted keys and certificates are accepted. • Certificates used to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public networks are confirmed as valid and are not expired or revoked. This bullet is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required as part of Requirement 4.2.1 and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment. • The protocol in use supports only secure versions or configurations and does not support fallback to, or use of insecure versions, algorithms, key sizes, or implementations. • The encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use. |
| 3.3 | Mask PAN when displayed |
| 2.3 | Encrypt all non-console administrative access |
| A2.1 | Encrypt PANs using strong cryptography when stored in removable electronic media |
