## ‚úÖ Integration Steps

1. Copy this folder into your DRTCE installation as `/frameworks/pci-dss-v4.0.1/`
2. Load via:
```python
from load_pci_dss import load_controls, load_roles, load_tasks, load_deliverables
controls = load_controls()
roles = load_roles()
```

3. Use these datasets to populate:
   - Coaching prompts
   - Role dashboards
   - Evidence validation modules

## üîê Notes

- UUIDs are consistent across controls
- Tags include both operational (`inference_tags`) and behavioral (`grc_subtags`)
- Role mappings and task structures are deduplicated and ready for coaching UX
